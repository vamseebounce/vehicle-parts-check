## Performance & Infrastructure (session 13)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| P1 | Remove Supabase Realtime `postgres_changes` → Broadcast pub/sub | ✅ | rsa.html + rsa-ticket-sync v19; zero WAL polling |
| P2 | Add 15-min idle guard on rsa.html + fw-map.html | ✅ | Stops polling when tabs left open overnight |
| P3 | Add off-hours guard to rsa-ticket-sync (midnight–6am IST skip) | ✅ | rsa-ticket-sync v19; saves ~180 cron runs/day |
| P4 | VACUUM rsa_tickets_cache + weekly cleanup-cron-history job | ✅ | Dead tuples 17.3% → 0%; cron.job_run_details auto-trims |
| P5 | Drop `rsa_ticket_locations_old` + `rsa_team_locations_old` | ✅ | migration 20260614000001; freed 3.7MB buffer cache |
| P6 | Investigate services loaded in RAM — optimize or drop what's unused | ✅ | PostGIS dropped (~80MB); pg_stat_statements dropped (~10MB); 7 remaining services are Supabase-managed, can't be removed |
| P7 | Upgrade compute Micro → Small (2 GB RAM) | ⬜ | BLOCKED: budget. Costs $5/month extra. Fixes red dot permanently |

---

## Hotfixes (production issues fixed outside phase order)

| # | Issue | Status | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| H1 | rsa-ticket-sync cron (job 13) dead since June 9 — over-escaped headers | ✅ | Recreated as job 17 with clean escaping. First success 2026-06-12 20:10 UTC |

---

## Admin Tools

Superadmin-only operational tooling. Sits with Manage Technicians + Permissions in the
sidebar's **Admin** section.

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|-------|
| A1 | Manual JC Approval Check (`jc-approval.html`) | ✅ | Search a vehicle → automated verdict (T0–T6) on whether to approve a manual draft-JC creation request. Replaces manual manager review. |

### A1 — Manual JC Approval Check

**What it does.** A manager searches a vehicle (reg or chassis) and gets a stable
tier verdict instead of manually checking booking/payment/DMS state. Tiers:

| Tier | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | NOT APPROVED | Booking in progress — rider is out now; never JC a live trip |
| T2 | APPROVED | Prior JC was deleted — safe to recreate |
| T3 | NO ACTION | Draft already exists for this trip |
| T4 | APPROVED | DMS push failed — recreate is the fix |
| T5a/b/c | PENDING | Payment pending / push stuck / push in flight |
| T6 | MANUAL REVIEW | Insufficient data |

**Architecture (security-reviewed — no public Metabase card in client).**
- **Query**: `sql/rrr/RRR_Manual_JC_Approval_Check.sql` — dual-booking model
  (current booking = "is rider out now?"; JC's own `booking_id` = "was a draft made for
  this trip?"). Lives in a **private** Metabase card.
- **Edge fn**: `jc-approval-sync` (cron **every 5 min**, JOB 20) fetches the card CSV
  server-side, rebuilds `jc_approval_status` (one row/vehicle, delete+reinsert) and diffs
  `jc_approval_alerts` (append-only log of T4/T5b/T6). Card UUID lives ONLY in the edge fn.
- **Frontend**: `jc-approval.html` reads `jc_approval_status` with the user's session
  token (RLS authenticated-read). Superadmin-gated via `is_superadmin` app_metadata.
  Design language mirrors `maintenance.html` (centered search hero, FleetPro topbar,
  random "Try:" pills, last-synced line, site-footer).

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20260619000001_jc_approval.sql`
(`jc_approval_status` + `jc_approval_alerts`, RLS + indexes).

**Pending**
- ⬜ Email notification on new T4/T5b/T6 alerts (`TODO(email)` in edge fn — transport
  not yet wired; the append-only log works without it).
- ⬜ Alert Centre page (reads `jc_approval_alerts`, lists actionable situations).

## Phase 1 — Security hardening (1–2 days)
*Do before sharing URLs any wider*

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | Rotate admin secret (`Login_key` / `Bounce@123`) in Supabase env vars | ✅ | Rotated 2026-06-13; no code change needed (user enters secret manually) |
| 1.2 | Remove all plaintext secrets from `Fleetpro-context.md` | ✅ | PAT + Bounce@123 redacted |
| 1.3 | Add `role` claim (`admin`/`ops`/`tech`) to `app_metadata` via admin-create-tech fn | ✅ | edge fn v5 deployed; role dropdown added to admin-techs.html; set_role action added |
| 1.4 | Replace RSA_EMAILS allowlist in fw-map with Supabase Auth + role check | ✅ | DB-driven via groups/group_features/user_groups. RSA_EMAILS kept as fallback. admin-permissions.html built for matrix management. |
| 1.5 | Replace admin-techs unlock screen with Supabase Auth + role check | ✅ | Two-stage: magic link → role=admin check → Login_key secret |
| 1.6 | RLS on `rsa_tickets_cache`: SELECT authenticated, INSERT/UPDATE service role only | ✅ | Removed anon policy; authenticated_select only; service_role bypasses |
| 1.7 | RLS on `bike_rider_cache` (rider PII): authenticated ops/admin only | ✅ | Removed public read policy; authenticated only |
| 1.8 | RLS on location tables: service-role write, authenticated read | ✅ | bike_location_cache, rsa_ticket_locations, rsa_team_locations — RLS enabled authenticated-only |
| 1.9 | Expose hub list via curated view, not base table | ✅ | `hubs` view created + migration 20260613000001; live in Supabase |
| 1.10 | `verify_jwt=true` on all browser-facing edge fns | ⏸ | Parked — do after Vite migration (Phase 3) when shared auth lib exists |
| 1.11 | Re-test all pages after RLS changes | ✅ | All edge fn logs 200; crons healthy; authenticated reads confirmed; anon blocked |

---

## Phase 2 — Data model: cache → system of record ✅ COMPLETE

## Open Decisions (needed before Phase 3+)

| # | Decision | Options | Lean |
|---|----------|---------|------|
| D1 | Hosting after build step | GitHub Pages vs **Vercel** | Vercel (preview deploys, Vercel MCP connected) |
| D2 | Staging backend | **Supabase branch** vs 2nd project | Branch (Pro feature, less key juggling) |
| D3 | TypeScript scope | **Lib-only TS**, pages stay JS | Lib-only |
| D4 | Metabase dependency | **Keep polling** vs go direct to Bass | Keep for now |
| D5 | Realtime strategy | **Broadcast pub/sub** (implemented) vs postgres_changes | Broadcast — done ✅ |
| D6 | Frontend framework | **Vite** (Phase 3 plan) vs **Next.js** (Amit suggestion) vs stay HTML | Next.js has better AI coding reliability + Server Components reduce PostgREST load; decide before Phase 3 |

## Permission System (built session 7)

| Object | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `groups` | Table | id, name, description. Current: RSA Field Team, RSA Warroom, Admin |
| `group_features` | Table | group_id → feature_key. RSA Field: fw-map. RSA Warroom: fw-map+rsa-warroom. Admin: all |
| `user_groups` | Table | user_id → group_id (one-to-many). Nishanth+Pavan in RSA Field Team |
| `admin-permissions` | Edge fn | list_groups, list_users, toggle_user_group, toggle_group_feature, create_group, delete_group. Protected by Login_key |
| `admin-permissions.html` | Page | Groups×Features matrix + Users×Groups matrix. Live checkbox toggles. |
| `loadUserPermissions()` | fw-map.html fn | Fetches user's features from DB. Falls back to RSA_EMAILS if no DB groups. |
| `window.FP_FEATURES` | Global | Feature map {key:true} set after login. Use fpCan('feature-key') anywhere on page. |

**Feature keys:** fw-map · rsa-warroom · tech-app · admin-panel · export-data · all-cities

**Permission tasks — completed session 14:**
- ✅ Superadmin role protected from group changes (admin-permissions edge fn, 403 on toggle_user_group)
- ✅ index.html sidebar + settings danger zone gated by FP_FEATURES['admin-panel'] (commit 5564db9); admin links in sidebar
- ✅ tech-app feature assigned to RSA Field Team in group_features
- ✅ rsa.html + all 5 gated pages have perm-veil + fpCan() checks (session 14)
